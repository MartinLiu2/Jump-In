# Jump-In
2021 SB Hacks Project

## Inspiration
Stuck in quarantine for almost a year, many of us have experienced and adapted to the new normal (the pandemic). We realized that although we started online school, had Zoom birthday parties, and even graduated on a livestream, exercise had taken a backseat in our lives. Being athletes ourselves, we missed the social aspect of being able to work out freely with our friends or the ability to participate in organized team sports. Thus, we created Jump In as a social platform that makes working out fun, collaborative, and safe during the pandemic. In addition, we put all the features we missed in fitness apps, from friend-workout groups, accountability tracking, to even designated places for coaches to give workout assignments. It’s important that we maintain our health during this pandemic, but we also believe that Jump In is here to stay even in the post-pandemic lifestyle—keeping us active and connected. 
 
Our ultimate vision is to use fitness as a medium to promote a healthier lifestyle. Whether it be connecting younger students missing physical education class or providing elderly citizens a safe environment for connecting during this chaotic time, Jump In will continually encourage them to be the best version of themselves through the unity and inspiration of fitness.

## What it does
Jump In is a social networking platform that encourages a healthy lifestyle by providing users a virtual collaborative fitness experience that is streamlined, engaging, and effective. 

## How we built it
Our team implemented an engineering design process in order to build Jump In. Initially, we brainstormed ideas for an application that could be helpful during the pandemic—eventually deciding to tackle a problem personal to our own team members and many, many more—the lack of genuine communication between individuals and decreasing physical activity. 
 
Using many concept drawings and artboard vision boards, we prototyped different design functions that would allow us to optimize the UI/UX while incorporating the software functions we deemed absolute. These concepts and artboards were then programmed into an InVision Studio Virtual Environment and eventually implemented as our Jump In prototype app (see attached links). 
 
Additionally, we wanted a realistic design of the back-end software system that Jump In would use. We created a model framework code for all critical features and major tabs in our application. This allowed us to further improve the user journey by implementing the most efficient user-data pipeline system. Furthermore, we utilized a Google Cloud MongoDataBase to power our user database and provide an endpoint for future API connections (e.g Jump In’s Alexa application [link](XXX)).

## Challenges we ran into
As a fully-freshman team with limited hacking experience, we were definitely unsure of our ability to create an app in such a limited time. Some challenges we faced included our prototype software encountering many errors and miscommunicating our design ideas with one another. Although it was extremely difficult to work on such a project virtually, we slowly learned the best ways to collaborate with one another. This was especially emphasized as we had to prototype on separate screens while managing a parallel workflow and maintaining effective version control. Despite these challenges, we are proud of what we were able to accomplish and extremely happy with the outcome of Jump In. 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We're proud of being able to come up with a potential solution that we deem important.

## What we learned
As a team of beginner hackers (some of us never coded before), we knew that SB Hacks would be a challenge for us. Especially in the virtual setting, we learned that delegation of assignments and scheduling our time appropriately would be important. Some lessons we learned were to have strong communication throughout the hackathon as well as being able to quickly adapt to app bugs or revisions. We are also happy to note that we all learned much more about coding, designing, and marketing (when it comes to our pitch and demo video). 

## What's next for Jump In
Jump In hopes to increase capabilities in terms of outreach capabilities, user journey, and data aggregation. We aim to make Jump In accessible to all ages and demographics, partnering with local schools and senior homes to host virtual events on the Jump In platform. In terms of technical improvements, the implementation of a stronger database authentication system and data-based algorithm to provide better user metrics/ recommendation system will allow us to improve Jump In in all aspects.
